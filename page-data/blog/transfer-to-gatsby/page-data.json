I just want to express my appreciation and thank to the Gatsby team!</p>\n<p>It has been a long time since I hope to decorating my blog on my own. And the barrier besides the time limit and my laziness has always been that I am reluctant to make a customized theme for hexo. Because, hexo, as a project started as early as 2012, which is prehistoric in web developing, require us to use view engine like ejs and jade to code theme. On the other hand, as a starter in this area, I hope to focus on one of the  mainstream frameworks, especially React. But writing my own blog from the very bottom would be too much time consuming. Therefore, I has been postponing days and days. The ugly interface of my blog had even harm my enthusiasm toward writing. As you could imagine, these formed a vicious circle.</p>\n<p>Until today.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, it came to me that why not learn from other great front-end developer from their blog as I always do, but this time, not only from the content but from the structure. And from there, I get to know about Gatsby, a framework on top of React that is so easy to use and shows so much freedom to developer. It is only the first day I get in touch with it. So it is unlikely I could dig deep enough for it. But look at the refreshing look of my blog after the transfer! I did not add any decoration from the tutorial and it is already satisfiable to me. Maybe gradually I will add the component I need such as code highlighting and imbedding html to markdown. And at that time I will record the procedures. By the way, the code of the blog would be present in the source branch of the repo.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Transfer to Gatsby!","date":"2019-01-30T14:00:00.000Z","tags":["gatsby"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/transfer-to-gatsby/"}}}
