{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Hexo is a fast static generator that could be used to help us build blog on github pages just like the one you are viewing. And as the first technical blog, I believe it is nice to introduce how this blog is created.</p>\n<h2>Prepare the environment</h2>\n<h3>Install node.js and npm</h3>\n<p>The blog is created on win10 platform and before using hexo, we need to install node.js and npm. There are plenty of detail tutorial for that. Therefore, in this article, I will just skip that.</p>\n<h3>Install Hexo</h3>\n<p>In the main page of <a href=\"https://hexo.io/\">Hexo</a>, you could find the command line for hexo-cli:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install hexo-cli -g\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which means install the hexo-cli globally.</p>\n<h2>Create the blog project</h2>\n<p>Next, we create the folder using the hexo-cli. In the case of github pages, we had better name the folder as <strong>your-github-username.github.io</strong>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">hexo init your-github-username.github.io\n</code></pre>\n<p>The hexo-cli would prepare a structured project. And now we use npm to install dependencies.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">cd your-github-username\nnpm install\n</code></pre>\n<p>And  now the project is ready, using the following commands to check what we have now!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">hexo g\nhexo s\n</code></pre>\n<p>Right now, the blog is visible at <a href=\"https://link.jianshu.com/?t=http://localhost:4000/\">http://localhost:4000/</a> .</p>\n<h2>Connect with Github</h2>\n<p>After creating the blog project locally, we need to connect our project with the github repository to use github pages service.</p>\n<p>Just create a repository names <strong>your-github-username.github.io</strong> and change the deploy part of  <strong>_config.yml</strong> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\"># Deployment\n## Docs: https://hexo.io/docs/deployment.html\ndeploy:\n  type: git\n  repository: https://github.com/your-github-username/your-github-username.github.io.git\n  branch: master\n</code></pre>\n<p>Run the hexo g again and use hexo to deploy.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">hexo g\nhexo d\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then you can visit <strong>your-github-username.github.io</strong> to check your blog!</p>\n<h2>Change theme</h2>\n<p>The default theme of Hexo is called landscape, you may find that is a bit out-of-date, isn't it? Now, let's change the theme.</p>\n<p>There are lots of pretty theme for your blog, I chose the material design theme (<a href=\"https://github.com/viosey/hexo-theme-material\">https://github.com/viosey/hexo-theme-material</a>) . To use this theme, simply clone it in the theme/material folder in your local folder.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">git clone git@github.com:viosey/hexo-theme-material.git ./theme/material\n</code></pre>\n<p>And change the <strong>_config.yml</strong> file correspondingly.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\"># Extensions\n## Plugins: https://hexo.io/plugins/\n## Themes: https://hexo.io/themes/\ntheme: material\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once again, generate and deploy the project.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">hexo g\nhexo d\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, you will find that the theme is changed.</p>\n<h2>Write blog</h2>\n<p>Now, we have the skeleton for our blog. It's time to bring the flesh. The <a href=\"https://hexo.io/docs/writing.html\">documentation of Hexo</a> has provided an excellent tutorial of how to write a new post.</p>\n<h2>Delete the default page</h2>\n<p>After writing your first blog, maybe you hope to delete the auto-generated \"hello world\" post. Here is the command for that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>First you need to delete the hello-world.md file in source/</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then using the following command</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">hexo clean\nhexo g\nhexo d\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Write Blog Using Hexo"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Write-Blog-Using-Hexo/"}}
