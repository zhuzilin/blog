And the barrier besides the time limit and my laziness has always been that I am reluctant to make a customized theme for hexo. Because, hexo, as a project started as early as 2012, which is prehistoric in web developing, require us to use view engine like ejs and jade to code theme. On the other hand, as a starter in this area, I hope to focus on one of the  mainstream frameworks, especially React. But writing my own blog from the very bottom would be too much time consuming. Therefore, I has been postponing days and days. The ugly interface of my blog had even harm my enthusiasm toward writing. As you could imagine, these formed a vicious circle.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":117},"end":{"line":4,"column":727,"offset":843},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":117},"end":{"line":4,"column":727,"offset":843},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Until today.","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":845},"end":{"line":6,"column":13,"offset":857},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":845},"end":{"line":6,"column":13,"offset":857},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Suddenly, it came to me that why not learn from other great front-end developer from their blog as I always do, but this time, not only from the content but from the structure.

So it is unlikely I could dig deep enough for it. But look at the refreshing look of my blog after the transfer! I did not add any decoration from the tutorial and it is already satisfiable to me. Maybe gradually I will add the component I need such as code highlighting and imbedding html to markdown. And at that time I will record the procedures.
